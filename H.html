<p align="left" style="color:white;">Rivers are the lifelines of our ecosystems, providing water, food, and livelihoods to millions. However, pollution, overuse, and neglect have pushed many of these vital resources to the brink of collapse. By addressing these issues, we are not just cleaning rivers—we are creating a sustainable future for all.</p>
